# Hey 👋🏻

I'm Kamyar Nadimi. I've been a software engineer since 2014, working on enterprise-scale software design and development.

The primary tools and languages I use daily are C#, JavaScript, ASP.NET, React, SQL, Powershell, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub, among other related technologies.

I'm not a big fan of social networks, not as much as I was in my teenagehood, but you may find me here and there.
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kmyrnx) - Online resume, professional networking.
- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159295278-kamyar) - Keeps track of my reading list.

If you are ever interested in contacting me, here is my [email](mailto:kmyrnx@gmail.com).
